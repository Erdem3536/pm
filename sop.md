# Stacks Governance Standard Operating Procedures

This document contains recommended best practices for managing various aspects of the Stacks governance initiative.

## Working group

There are a number of working groups in the Blockstack community. Governance is one such group; others include Business Models and Proof of Transfer (PoX). Each working group has a designated sub-category on the [Blockstack Community Forum](https://forum.blockstack.org/): here is the [Working Groups/Governance](https://forum.blockstack.org/c/Working-Groups/governance) category. Each working group also has a designated channel on the [Blockstack Discord server](http://chat.blockstack.org/). Note that, at present, Blockstack PBC is responsible for administering both the Forum and the Discord server.

### Governance calls

Each week, the members of the governance working group meet on a call. These are currently scheduled everyday Wednesday at 10am New York time. The agenda for the next call is posted as a GitHub issue in this repository, and the notes and other resources for previous calls are posted in [the calls subfolder](https://github.com/stacksgov/resources/tree/master/calls) of the `stacksgov/resources` repository.

### Preparing for a call

Here are the steps you should take to prepare for an upcoming working group call.

1. Determine who will moderate the call, and who will be responsible for taking notes.
1. Open a [new issue](https://github.com/stacksgov/pm/issues/new) for the call agenda in this repository. Use the previous call agenda as a template ([full list](https://github.com/stacksgov/pm/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Acall+)), updating the call times in various timezones, assigned call moderator, and agenda items. When updating call times, be especially careful of the times of year—autumn, and spring—when different regions switch timezones at different times, which means that the relative times may change as well. Creating an "Event Time Announcer" on timeanddate.com ([sample](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Stacks+Governance+Working+Group+Call&iso=20200401T10&p1=179&ah=1)) can be very helpful here, as it allows people to easily verify the time in their timezone.
1. Add the "call" label to the issue.
1. Close the issue for the previous call, with the text "Closing in favor of #X" where "X" is the number of the new issue. This will link the two issues and makes navigating among call agendas much easier.

### Hosting a call

1. 24 hours before the call, remind everyone in the working group channel about the upcoming meeting, using the `@everyone` tag. Include a link to the agenda issue. Here's a sample message:

> Hey @everyone, reminder that our next governance working group call is in 24 hours! Agenda is here, please review it before the call and feel free to propose topics: https://github.com/stacksgov/pm/issues/19. See you all tomorrow!

### After a call
